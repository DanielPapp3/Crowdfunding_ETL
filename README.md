# Crowdfunding_ETL

Partner: Alkida Frroku (NOTE: My code is different from my partner's code!)

This repo contains project files relating to a ETL project which had students extracting data from Microsoft Excel files using Python/Pandas, transforming the data in Pandas DataFrames, and loading the results into several CSV files. Finally, students loaded data from the exported CSV files into a PostgreSQL database.

The original Excel files (as well as the exported CSV files created during the project) can be found within the Resources folder of this repository.

The schema for the PostgreSQL database as well as the file with the SELECT statements used to confirm successful import and the ERD can be found within the root directory of this repository.

The code used to conduct this ETL process can be found in the root directory of this repository. It is entitled "ETL_Mini_Project_DPapp.ipynb".
